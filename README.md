# Description

A simple to-do List that incorporates old-school (slow) HTTP Polling to produce a (quasi) live data update task list shareable between you and friends.

My first, humble project, built using JQuery and styled with Bootstrap. 

# Installation

To have your own local copy, navgiate in your command line to the approriate directory where you want the app installed, and run git clone

<code><pre>$ git clone  https://github.com/tdraper-dev/dawdlist.git</pre></code>

Navigate into the cloned repository,

<code><pre>$ cd dawdlist</pre></code>


And there you have it! In order to run the program, you'll either need to host it on a site service like Netlify or Heroku, or create a simple server to run it locally through localhost.

Please do note, this app links to no sensitive data and as an early project lacks adequate security measures. Use at your own risk (and maybe add some security features)!
